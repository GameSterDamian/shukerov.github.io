So I guess I can start writing, and doing some blogging already. The first blog would be me figuring out how to deal with middleman and configure it to do syntax highlighting, as well as use partials to format my web page.

```python
	s = "python syntax highlighting test"
	print s <b>tag</b>.
```

```ruby
	def my_cool_method(message)
	  puts message
	end
```
