     <span id="hello-text">Hey there!</span>
    <p> I am an international student studying Computer Science at Cal Poly, and a programmer in my free time. I was born and raised in Bulgaria. For the past 4 years I have been living in the US, working on getting my degree done. I like programming, creating, hiking, riding my bicycle, surfing and this list is about to get too long if I keep this going.</p>
    <p id="highlight"> About this website </p>
    <p> This website was created mainly for practice, and documentation for myself (or others, like you, who happen to stumble on it).</p>
    <p> Here you will mainly find blog posts about technologies I use, and configurations for my machine. At some point you will also be able to read about projects that I am currently involved in, as well as some blog posts about my classes.</p>
    <span id="goodbye-text">Thanks for visiting, and be sure to checkout my blog.</span>
